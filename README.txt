This program runs a game of hangman. The rules and required user input are printed as the code runs.
This program uses serialization to save the number of wins and losses. 
To verify the save state is working, play a round of hangman, then stop the program by saying you do not wish to play again. Then, run the program again, where it should print the number of wins and losses the same as they had been displayed at the end of your previous game.
